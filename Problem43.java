    // 1. Multiple Inheritance: A class can implement multiple interfaces, but can extend only one abstract class.
    // 2. Fields: Interfaces can have only public static final fields (constants). Abstract classes can have instance variables.
    // 3. Constructors: Interfaces cannot have constructors. Abstract classes can have constructors.
